bin-hacks
=========

Gathered from around the internet, these are short executables for a
Linux user's ~/bin directory, too small to re-distribute separately.

**fix-agent.sh** If you reconnect to a screen session, source
  fix-agent.sh to reach your ssh-agent again, for passwordless login.

**prompt-vars.sh** Source this to customize your shell prompt. Uses
  git-prompt.sh from the git distribution, to summarize the git status
  when you are in a git repo.
